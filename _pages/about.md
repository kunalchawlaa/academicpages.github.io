I currently work on image-based product retrieval in Samsung Research, Seoul. I attained my undergraduate degree from IIT Delhi in Computer Science and Engineering(CSE) in 2015. My broad interests lie in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with a focus on Vision, NLP and Deep Learning. \\

My current focus is on improving real-time deep-learning based object detection performance, as well as classification, deep metric learning, GAN-based image generation and related areas of Computer Vision. In the past I have worked on semantic understanding of and information extraction from natural language; and inference in various probabilistic graphical models like Markov Random Fields. \\
