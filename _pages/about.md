I am currently a masters student specialising in Machine Learning. My previous job was in Samsung Research, Seoul, where I worked on image-based image retrieval and knowledge based question answering. My broad interests lie in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with a focus on Vision, NLP and Deep Learning.

In the past I have worked on deep-learning based object detection, language generation as well as classification, deep metric learning and GAN-based image generation. I also have experience in semantic understanding of and information extraction from natural language; and inference in various probabilistic graphical models like Markov Random Fields.
